    <h1>India's Contribution to Satellite Technology</h1>

    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>
        India has made significant strides in satellite technology through projects like GSAT and NAVIC. These satellites play a crucial role in communication, navigation, weather prediction, and disaster management, benefiting millions across the country.
    </p>

    <h2>GSAT: Communication Satellites</h2>
    <p>
        GSAT (Geosynchronous Satellite) series supports India's communication network. These satellites enable:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Television broadcasting and internet connectivity in remote areas.</li>
        <li>Efficient communication during emergencies.</li>
        <li>Facilitation of e-learning and telemedicine services.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>NAVIC: India's Regional GPS System</h2>
    <p>
        NAVIC (Navigation with Indian Constellation) is a regional satellite navigation system designed by ISRO. It helps in:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Accurate navigation for fishermen and travelers.</li>
        <li>Supporting transport and logistics with reliable positioning services.</li>
        <li>Military and security applications.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Applications in Weather Prediction</h2>
    <p>
        Indian satellites monitor weather patterns and predict natural calamities like cyclones and heavy rains. This helps in issuing early warnings to save lives and property.
    </p>

    <h2>Role in Disaster Management</h2>
    <p>
        Satellites play a key role in managing disasters by:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Providing real-time images of affected areas.</li>
        <li>Facilitating effective coordination during relief operations.</li>
        <li>Tracking and assessing the impact of disasters like floods and earthquakes.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Importance of Satellite Technology</h2>
