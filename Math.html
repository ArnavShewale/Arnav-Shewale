    <h1>Contributions of Indian Mathematicians</h1>

    <h2>Aryabhata</h2>
    <p>Aryabhata was one of the first major mathematicians and astronomers from India. He is known for his work in mathematics, particularly in the fields of algebra and trigonometry. He introduced the concept of zero and the place value system.</p>
    <p>Aryabhatiya was particularly popular in South India, where numerous mathematicians over the ensuing millennium wrote commentaries. The work was written in verse couplets and deals with mathematics and astronomy.</p>
    <p>Aryabhatta mentions in the Aryabhatiya that it was composed 3,600 years into the Kali Yuga, when he was 23 years old. This corresponds to 499 CE, and implies that he was born in 476.</p>

    <h2>Brahmagupta</h2>
    <p>Brahmagupta was an ancient Indian mathematician and astronomer who made significant contributions to mathematics, including rules for arithmetic operations involving zero and negative numbers. His work laid the foundation for future mathematicians.</p>
    <p>Brahmagupta, according to his own statement, was born in 598 CE. Born in Bhillamāla in Gurjaradesa (modern Bhinmal in Rajasthan, India) during the reign of the Chavda dynasty ruler Vyagrahamukha. He was the son of Jishnugupta and was a Hindu by religion, in particular, a Shaivite. He lived and worked there for a good part of his life.</p>
    <p>In 628 CE, Brahmagupta first described gravity as an attractive force, and used the term "gurutvākarṣaṇam (गुरुत्वाकर्षणम्)" in Sanskrit to describe it. He is also credited with the first clear description of the quadratic formula (the solution of the quadratic equation) in his main work, the Brāhma-sphuṭa-siddhānta.</p>

    <h2>Srinivasa Ramanujan</h2>
    <p>Srinivasa Ramanujan Aiyangar was an Indian mathematician. Often regarded as one of the greatest mathematicians of all time, though he had almost no formal training in pure mathematics, he made substantial contributions to mathematical analysis, number theory, infinite series, and continued fractions, including solutions to mathematical problems then considered unsolvable.</p>
    <p>Ramanujan initially developed his own mathematical research in isolation. According to Hans Eysenck, "he tried to interest the leading professional mathematicians in his work, but failed for the most part. What he had to show them was too novel, too unfamiliar, and additionally presented in unusual ways; they could not be bothered." Seeking mathematicians who could better understand his work.</p>
    <p>During his short life, Ramanujan independently compiled nearly 3,900 results. Many were completely novel; his original and highly unconventional results, such as the Ramanujan prime, the Ramanujan theta function, partition formulae and mock theta functions, have opened entire new areas of work and inspired further research. Of his thousands of results, most have been proven correct.</p>
